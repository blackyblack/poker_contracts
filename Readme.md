# Poker Contracts

Contracts that resolve settlements for a Mental Poker game. Deposits are locked when the game starts and the pot is paid out when the game is settled.

## Development

Install dependencies and compile the contracts with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/):

```
npm install
npm run compile
```
