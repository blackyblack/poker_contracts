## Implementation Details

### Function Signatures

```solidity
// Verify player A's hole cards (indices 0-1)
function verifyHoleA(
    bytes memory pkB,
    bytes[] memory bDeckSigned,
    bytes memory card1Opener,
    bytes memory card2Opener
) internal view returns (bool)

// Verify player B's hole cards (indices 2-3)
function verifyHoleB(
    bytes memory pkA,
    bytes[] memory bDeckSigned,
    bytes memory card1Opener,
    bytes memory card2Opener
) internal view returns (bool)

// Verify flop cards (indices 4-6)
function verifyFlop(
    bytes memory pkA,
    bytes memory pkB,
    bytes[] memory bDeckSigned,
    bytes[] memory cardAOpeners,
    bytes[] memory cardBOpeners
) internal view returns (bool)

// Verify turn card (index 7)
function verifyTurn(
    bytes memory pkA,
    bytes memory pkB,
    bytes[] memory bDeckSigned,
    bytes memory cardAOpener,
    bytes memory cardBOpener
) internal view returns (bool)

// Verify river card (index 8)
function verifyRiver(
    bytes memory pkA,
    bytes memory pkB,
    bytes[] memory bDeckSigned,
    bytes memory cardAOpener,
    bytes memory cardBOpener
) internal view returns (bool)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Hole Cards**: Only opponent decrypts (player already knows their own cards)
2. **Public Cards**: Both players decrypt sequentially (A first, then B)
3. **Validation**: All functions validate input lengths before processing
4. **Gas Efficiency**: Short-circuit evaluation returns false on first invalid card
5. **Security**: Uses BN254 pairing precompiles for cryptographic verification

### Testing Strategy

Tests cover:
- ✅ Valid decryptions for all card types
- ✅ Invalid decryptions (wrong pairing)
- ✅ Input length validation
- ✅ Deck size validation
- ✅ Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Cryptographic Verification

The library verifies partial decryptions using BN254 pairing:

**For hole cards:**
```
e(bDeckSigned[i], pkOpponent) == e(opener[i], G2_BASE)
```

**For public cards:**
```
e(bDeckSigned[i], pkA) == e(openerA[i], G2_BASE) AND
e(openerA[i], pkB) == e(openerB[i], G2_BASE)
```

This ensures that:
1. Decryption keys match the public keys
2. Partial decryptions are correctly computed
3. No player can cheat by providing incorrect data

## Use Cases

This library enables smart contracts to:

1. **Force card reveals**: Players must provide correct decryption data or forfeit
2. **Resolve disputes**: Cryptographically verify that cards were correctly revealed
3. **Prevent cheating**: Ensure players cannot refuse to reveal cards when they lose
4. **Automate showdowns**: Smart contract can verify all card revelations automatically

## Requirements Met

✅ All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented:
- verifyHoleA with correct signature and behavior
- verifyHoleB for player B's hole cards (cards 3-4 in deck)
- verifyFlop for 3 public cards with both players' keys
- verifyTurn for turn card
- verifyRiver for river card

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Code implemented
2. ✅ Tests written
3. ✅ Documentation completed
4. ⏳ Waiting for CI pipeline to compile and run tests
5. ⏳ Final review and merge

## Notes

- Implementation uses minimal changes to existing codebase
- Leverages existing Bn254 library for cryptographic operations
- Follows repository conventions and style
- Node.js 22.x required for compilation (available in CI)
- All tests will run in GitHub Actions CI pipeline
