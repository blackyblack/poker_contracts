# Secure settleFold Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a secure `settleFold` function that replaces the previous unsafe implementation with full signature verification and game simulation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Function Signature Changed
**Before:**
```solidity
function settleFold(uint256 channelId, address winner) external nonReentrant
```

**After:**
```solidity
function settleFold(
    uint256 channelId,
    uint256 handId,
    Action[] calldata actions,
    bytes[] calldata signatures
) external nonReentrant
```

### 2. Security Improvements

#### Co-signed Action Verification
- Every action must be signed by both players using EIP712
- Signatures are verified using `ECDSA.recover()` 
- Actions must match the specified `channelId` and `handId`
- Signature count must be exactly `actions.length * 2`

#### Game Simulation Verification  
- Uses `HeadsUpPokerReplay.replayAndGetEndState()` to simulate the game
- Verifies that the action sequence ends in `End.FOLD` state
- Automatically determines the winner as the non-folder from simulation
- No arbitrary winner parameter - completely trustless

#### Additional Validations
- Checks that actions array is not empty
- Verifies channel exists and is not in showdown
- Ensures proper action sequence and previous hash chain

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Imports Added
```solidity
import {HeadsUpPokerReplay} from "./HeadsUpPokerReplay.sol";
import {Action} from "./HeadsUpPokerActions.sol";
```

#### New State Variable
```solidity
HeadsUpPokerReplay private immutable replay;
```

#### Constructor Addition
```solidity
constructor() {
    replay = new HeadsUpPokerReplay();
}
```

#### New Error Types
```solidity
error ActionSignatureLengthMismatch();
error ActionWrongChannel();
error ActionWrongHand();
error ActionWrongSignerA();
error ActionWrongSignerB();
error ReplayDidNotEndInFold();
error NoActionsProvided();
```

### 4. Security Analysis

#### Attack Vectors Prevented
1. **Arbitrary Winner Selection**: No longer possible to claim victory without proof
2. **Forged Actions**: All actions must be co-signed by both players
3. **Invalid Game States**: Game simulation ensures actions represent a valid poker hand
4. **Wrong Channel/Hand**: Actions are validated against specific channel and hand IDs

#### Trust Model
- **Before**: Required trust that the caller is honest about who won
- **After**: Completely trustless - smart contract verifies the entire game transcript

### 5. Backward Compatibility

#### Test Updates
- Updated all existing tests to use new signature
- Created helper functions to maintain test readability
- Added comprehensive security-focused test suite

#### Helper Functions Created
```javascript
// Creates properly signed fold scenarios for testing
async function settleFoldLegacy(escrow, channelId, winner, player1, player2, chainId)

// Builds action sequences with proper hash chains
function buildActions(specs, channelId, handId)

// Signs actions with both players using EIP712
async function signActions(actions, signers, contractAddress, chainId)
```

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Create a valid fold scenario
const actions = buildActions([
    { action: ACTION.SMALL_BLIND, amount: 1n },
    { action: ACTION.BIG_BLIND, amount: 2n },
    { action: ACTION.FOLD, amount: 0n } // Small blind folds
], channelId, handId);

// Both players sign all actions
const signatures = await signActions(actions, [player1, player2], escrowAddress, chainId);

// Settle with cryptographic proof
await escrow.settleFold(channelId, handId, actions, signatures);
```
